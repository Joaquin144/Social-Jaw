## Architecture

The Social Media app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern. The app's codebase is organized into the following packages:

- `di`: Contains the AppModule class for providing dependecies needed for app
- `data`: Handles data retrieval and manipulation, including interaction with Firebase Firestore.
- `services`: Contains Firebase messaging service for handling app notifications
- `ui`: Implements the UI using Jetpack Compose and handles user interactions.
- `utils`: Cotains utility classes for use throught the app module

The app utilizes the following architectural components:

- **ViewModel**: Manages and provides data to the UI components, maintaining separation between the UI and business logic.
- **Repository**: Acts as a single source of truth for data, abstracting the data sources and providing data to the ViewModel.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, enabling easy management of dependencies throughout the app.

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin
- Android Jetpack (Compose, Navigation, ViewModel, etc.)
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging)
- Material Design Components
- Retrofit and Json

3. Set up Firebase project and configure the necessary services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) by following the Firebase documentation.
